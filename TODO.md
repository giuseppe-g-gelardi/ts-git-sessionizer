  },
  "dependencies": false
}

set up the scripty things:
git clone {url}
...
cd into repo_name
if deps, install need to figure out how to do this with each language
-- keep it npm, pnpm, yarn for now.

-> if tmux, -- tmux new -s {repo_name}
-> check alias, if not alias, use std command [need to make a list of std commands forEach editor]
-> open editor with alias or std command
-> close program at this point???
