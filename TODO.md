## make a back button


-- 

# for each description, create an array of short descriptions 
# - that get chosen randomly each time the program runs.
# - - they should be short enough to fit on the screen and range from funny to passive aggressive to helpful
example: 
 - vim: if youre a super chad -- or something to that effect
 - neovim: does your linked in say "open to work" and you spend all day watching the primeagen?
 - vscode: you're a web developer, aren't you?
