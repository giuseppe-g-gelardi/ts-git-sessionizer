# ts-git-sessionizer

### a little project to automate the creation of a sessionized git repo in your editor of choice, with tmux. or not...

the application uses github authentication and some interactive prompts to {hopefully} ...
 - init the application 
 - - does some basic auth and saves settings to a .configrc file.
 - clone a repository
 - cd into the directory
 - start a tmux session, if that's your cup of tea
 - and finally, open the repo in your preferred editor
